# [React Deep Dive: Build a React App With Webpack][published url]
## Instructor: [Pavan Podila][instructor url]


React is a library for building user interfaces that has taken the web development world by storm. With an innovative model for efficient rendering to a "virtual DOM", an ecosystem of thousands of related modules on NPM, and a complex toolchain, React is a powerful and subtle technology. But this means it can sometimes be hard to get up to speed for full-scale app development.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Pavan Podila will take you on a deep dive into ReactJS by building a complex app that makes use of libraries such as D3, React-Bootstrap, and FixedDataTable. You'll learn how to use tools such as Webpack that are necessary to build any full-fledged React app. You'll also see how to write React apps in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) for a cleaner and more elegant syntax.

The course project will be to build a HAR (Http ARchive) file viewer. HAR files are a representation the network traffic in a web browser. Chrome has a built-in support in the Network panel of DevTools. You will build your own version of this functionality with a custom HAR viewer.

By the end of this course, you will have a stronger grasp on starting your own React projects, organizing your code using React components, and bundling your app code with Webpack. You'll also learn a professional dev workflow for React. You'll walk away with a stronger understanding of React components and their lifecycle by learning how to wrap existing 3rd-party libraries within React components.
